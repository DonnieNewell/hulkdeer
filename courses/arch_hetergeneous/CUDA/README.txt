Homework 3
18Oct2011


To Build:

Just type 'make'. It will create two executables, vector_add and hw3. hw3 is our homework submission.

-or-

type 'make hw3' to only build the homework 3 executable.

To Clean:

type 'make clean'


About:
The structure of our code was based on the example vector_add program that was provided in the Assignment instructions.
That code was provided in our submission along with our code for clarity.
This code was developed on barracuda13.cs.virginia.edu and tesla.cs.virginia.edu. 
The OS used was Ubuntu. The gpu was an NVIDIA Fermi chip. 
We did pair programming, and Jack Wadden did most of the coding since he had not done GPU programming before. 
I (Donnie Newell) cleaned up the comments, code style, and output for submission, as well as assisted Jack with 
algorithm development. I also wrote this README and the writeup I submitted on collab.
