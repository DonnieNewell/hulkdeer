\subsection{k-partially sort}
An array of n numbers is $k$-way partially sorted if the array is divided into $\frac{n}{k}$ partitions of $k$ elements each. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that iteratively sorts an array of n numbers by partially sorting with smaller and smaller $k$ values until $k = 1$. After iteration $i$ of quicksort the array is $\frac{n}{2^i}$ -way partially sorted. It follows that the array is $k$-way partially sorted after $n \lceil\lg(\frac{n}{k})\rceil$ iterations.
